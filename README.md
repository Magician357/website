Feel free to take any part of this website for yourself, just please make sure to credit me.

This is just a suggestion, however, and this website is under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

I doubt you would want to anyway, since it is probably not efficient.

This website is still in development. Please do not judge.

I may come back and add things later if needed. (Probably true)
